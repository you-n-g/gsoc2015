## Abstract
Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement. [Make kubectl awesome](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/5275) is part of the potential improvemens. I love opensource and I'm Interested in Kubernetes. So I'm applying kubernetes as my GSOC2015 project.


## Project Proposal

I'm a master student in UCAS. I love opensource and use [github](https://github.com/you-n-g) quite often. I've some experience of developing systems used by a lot of people, such as [”The Challenge Cup” Online Contest Platform](http://www.tiaozhanbei.net/). I recently learned a lot about docker, kubernetes and GO.  So far I have committed [some patches to Kubernetes](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/commits?author=you-n-g).
So I decide to apply kubernetes as my GSOC2015 prject and contribute my efforts to [Make kubectl awesome](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/5275).  Some ideas for kubectl improvements are listed in the [CLI roadmap](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/cli-roadmap.md). I plan to pick up some of them to make up my GSOC 2015 project.


## Schedule

I’m planning to devote 4 to 5 hours each day from monday to friday and 7 to 8 hours each day in the weekend. Sum up to 34~41 hours a week. I really want to start early to ensure the project is finished on time. I’m certainly willing to make more efforts if the project is behind schedule.

The final deliverable would consist of the 26 items listed in the [CLI roadmap](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/cli-roadmap.md). If I have time after finishing these, I'm really glad to contribute my time to other features listed there.

Because I've been familiar with Kubernetes and the community already, I think I can begin coding from April 27 at the latest(I plan to finish some features before that time). There will be about 16 weeks for coding. Accordingly, my planned schedule(the items in my schedule correspond to the items in the [CLI roadmap](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/cli-roadmap.md)):
- week 1~2: item 1~3
- week 3~4: item 4~5. ([item 6](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/pull/5543) is finished a few days ago by me)
- week 5~6: item 7~9
- week 7~8: item 10~12
- week 9~10: item 13~14
- week 11~12: item 15~18
- week 13~14: item 19~22
- week 15~16: item 23~26


## Why Kubernetes
I have some experience about Docker and cloud computing and I'm interested in them. Then I found  Kubernetes closely related to them and really fascinating. Besides, the community is really friendly and is a good place for me to learn some knowledge. What's more, I believe Kubernetes will serve numerous projects in the future, it's extremely cool!!!!
